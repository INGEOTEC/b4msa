b4msa is multilingual framework, that can be served as a baseline for sentiment analysis
classifiers, as well as a starting point to build new sentiment analysis
systems.

b4msa extends our work on creating a text classifier (see `microTC
<http://github.com/ingeotec/microtc>`_) by incorporating different
language dependent techniques such as:

* Stemming
* Stopword
* Negations

The documentation is on `readthedocs <https://b4msa.readthedocs.io>`_.
